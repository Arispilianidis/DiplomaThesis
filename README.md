Automatic digital transformation of business processes to web applications

Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to create new - or modify 
existing - business processes to respond to changing market needs. So, the need is obvious, 
especially now, because of the ongoing pandemic, where companies need to adapt quickly to 
the required changes in the way they operate. This diploma thesis aspires to respond to the 
above need, automating the digital transformation of business processes, emphasizing in the 
human resources department, and producing specialized web applications for each of them.

As part of this effort, in this diploma thesis, MDE (Model Driven Engineering) is utilized. More 
specifically, once an abstract process model is defined, a series of transformations takes place, 
resulting in a functional full-stack application for it. In this way, the software development 
process is accelerated, and software is produced more reliably.

In this diploma thesis, the EzProcess system is implemented, in which the user through a 
friendly graphical user interface, sets parameters for the business processes of the human 
resources department, that he wants to transform. These processes refer specifically to the 
description of a job, the evaluation of the candidates who applied for the above position and 
finally their onboarding into the company with their successful evaluation. In addition, the 
above processes are interdependent in the EzProcess system, resulting in fewer human 
mistakes and at the same time even easier and faster software development. Based on these 
parameters the user has set, the executable code that performs the digital transformation of 
the processes is created and the corresponding web applications, which include both the 
client and the server part, are generated. The latter provide in the background additional 
capabilities of user identification, sorting and database search of candidates, by 
communicating with the generated server API.
